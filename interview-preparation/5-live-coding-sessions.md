# Live Coding Sessions

## Algorithm-Focused Live Coding
- **Format**: Shared editor without IntelliSense/autocomplete
- **Challenge**: No IDE assistance, syntax highlighting only
- **Focus**: Problem-solving process and coding under pressure
- **Strategy**:
  - Think aloud throughout the process
  - Start with brute force, then optimize
  - Write comments to outline approach
  - Test with simple examples manually

## Project-Based Live Coding
- **Format**: Build a small feature or component
- **Duration**: 45-90 minutes
- **Scope**: Mini-application, API endpoint, or UI component
- **Success factors**:
  - Plan architecture before coding
  - Write modular, testable code
  - Handle error cases
  - Explain design decisions

## IDE-Based Interviews

### With Your Own IDE
- **Setup**: Use your familiar development environment
- **Advantage**: Access to your preferred tools and shortcuts
- **Focus**: Code organization, debugging skills, workflow
- **Preparation**:
  - Clean up your IDE setup
  - Know your shortcuts well
  - Practice screen sharing
  - Prepare code templates

### Problem from Document
- **Format**: Problem description in shared Google Doc/MS Word
- **Process**: Read requirements, ask questions, then code
- **Challenge**: Translating written specs to working code
- **Skills tested**:
  - Requirements analysis
  - Code organization
  - Documentation reading
  - Clarification seeking

## Success Strategies

### Communication
- **Think out loud**: Verbalize your thought process
- **Ask clarifying questions**: Ensure you understand requirements
- **Explain trade-offs**: Discuss different approaches and their pros/cons
- **Seek feedback**: Ask if your approach makes sense

### Technical Approach
- **Start simple**: Begin with working solution, then optimize
- **Write clean code**: Use good variable names and structure
- **Test as you go**: Verify functionality with examples
- **Handle edge cases**: Consider boundary conditions

### Time Management
- **Plan before coding**: Spend time understanding the problem
- **Prioritize functionality**: Get core features working first
- **Iterate and improve**: Add features and optimize incrementally
- **Leave time for testing**: Reserve time to verify your solution
