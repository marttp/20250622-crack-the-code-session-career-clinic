# Written Exams (สอบข้อเขียน เป็นกระดาษ)

## Format and Challenges
- **Format**: Handwritten code on paper
- **Duration**: Usually 30-60 minutes
- **Challenges**: 
  - No syntax checking or autocomplete
  - Limited space for corrections
  - Harder to test code mentally
  - No copy/paste or undo functionality

## Strategies for Success

### Planning Phase
- **Read the entire problem**: Don't start writing immediately
- **Understand requirements**: Note constraints and expected output
- **Plan your solution**: Think through approach before writing
- **Consider edge cases**: Think about boundary conditions
- **Estimate space needed**: Plan your layout on paper

### Writing Phase
- **Write clearly**: Use legible handwriting
- **Organize code well**: Proper indentation and spacing
- **Leave space for corrections**: Don't cram code together
- **Use consistent style**: Maintain formatting throughout
- **Focus on logic over syntax**: Prioritize correctness over perfect syntax

### Testing Phase
- **Trace through examples**: Walk through your code manually
- **Check edge cases**: Verify boundary conditions
- **Look for common errors**: Off-by-one errors, null checks
- **Review variable names**: Ensure consistency
- **Verify logic flow**: Check if/else conditions and loops

## Common Paper Coding Topics

### Algorithm Implementation
- **Sorting algorithms**: Bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort
- **Search algorithms**: Binary search, linear search
- **String manipulation**: Palindrome check, anagram detection
- **Array operations**: Find duplicates, rotate array, two sum

### Data Structure Operations
- **Linked list**: Insert, delete, reverse operations
- **Stack/Queue**: Implementation and basic operations
- **Tree traversal**: Inorder, preorder, postorder
- **Hash table**: Basic implementation concepts

### Problem-Solving Patterns
- **Two pointers**: Palindrome check, two sum
- **Sliding window**: Substring problems
- **Recursion**: Factorial, Fibonacci, tree problems
- **Dynamic programming**: Simple DP problems

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
```
// Good structure example:
1. Function signature with clear parameters
2. Input validation (if needed)
3. Main algorithm logic
4. Return statement
5. Comments for complex parts
```

### Variable Naming
- Use descriptive names even if longer
- Be consistent with naming conventions
- Avoid abbreviations that might be unclear
- Use standard loop variables (i, j, k)

### Error Handling
- Consider null/undefined inputs
- Handle edge cases (empty arrays, single elements)
- Think about integer overflow (if relevant)
- Validate assumptions in comments

## Practice Tips

### Preparation
- **Practice writing code by hand**: Get comfortable with pen and paper
- **Time yourself**: Practice within time constraints
- **Review common algorithms**: Know basic implementations by heart
- **Practice neat handwriting**: Ensure code is readable

### During the Exam
- **Stay calm**: Don't panic if you make mistakes
- **Use scratch space**: Work out examples on side
- **Cross out cleanly**: If you need to make corrections
- **Ask for more paper**: If you run out of space
- **Manage time**: Don't spend too long on one problem

## What Examiners Look For
- **Correct logic**: Does the algorithm solve the problem?
- **Code structure**: Is the code well-organized and readable?
- **Edge case handling**: Does it handle boundary conditions?
- **Efficiency awareness**: Shows understanding of time/space complexity
- **Clear thinking**: Evidence of systematic problem-solving approach
