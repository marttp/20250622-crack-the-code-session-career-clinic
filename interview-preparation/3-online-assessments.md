# Online Assessment (OA) Platforms

## HackerRank
- **Format**: Timed coding challenges (usually 1-3 hours)
- **Environment**: Web-based IDE with limited debugging tools
- **Focus**: Algorithm implementation, problem-solving speed
- **Tips**: 
  - Practice on HackerRank platform beforehand
  - Read problem statements carefully
  - Test with provided examples first
  - Manage time effectively across multiple problems

## Codility
- **Format**: Performance-focused coding tests
- **Environment**: Browser-based editor with real-time scoring
- **Focus**: Correctness and efficiency (time/space complexity)
- **Tips**:
  - Solutions are graded automatically
  - Pay attention to edge cases
  - Optimize for both correctness and performance
  - Review complexity requirements carefully

## CodeSignal (Real Example)
- **Format**: Game-like coding challenges with immediate feedback
- **Environment**: Interactive platform with hints and explanations
- **Focus**: Problem-solving progression and code quality
- **Tips**:
  - Start with easier problems to build confidence
  - Use hints strategically
  - Focus on clean, readable solutions
  - Practice different difficulty levels

## General OA Success Tips

### Before the Assessment
- **Practice on the platform**: Familiarize yourself with the interface
- **Check technical requirements**: Ensure stable internet and compatible browser
- **Prepare environment**: Quiet space, good lighting, backup internet
- **Review fundamentals**: Brush up on basic algorithms and data structures

### During the Assessment
- **Read carefully**: Understand problem requirements before coding
- **Plan your approach**: Think through the solution before implementing
- **Test with examples**: Verify your solution with provided test cases
- **Manage time**: Don't spend too long on any single problem
- **Submit working solutions**: Partial credit is better than no credit

### Common Pitfalls
- **Rushing**: Not reading the problem statement thoroughly
- **Over-optimization**: Spending too much time on micro-optimizations
- **Ignoring constraints**: Not considering input size or time limits
- **Poor time management**: Getting stuck on difficult problems
- **Not testing**: Submitting without verifying with examples
